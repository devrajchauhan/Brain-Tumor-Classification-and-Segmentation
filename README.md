# Brain-Tumor-Classification-and-Segmentation
**Title:** Integrated Brain Tumor Classification and Segmentation using Custom CNN Architectures and Transfer Learning

**Dataset Used:** https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427

This brain tumor dataset containing 3064 T1-weighted contrast-inhanced images from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumor: meningioma (708 slices), 
glioma (1426 slices), and pituitary tumor (930 slices). Due to the file size limit of repository, we split the whole dataset into 4 subsets, and achive 
them in 4 .zip files with each .zip file containing 766 slices.The 5-fold cross-validation indices are also provided.

This data is organized in matlab data format (.mat file). Each file stores a struct containing the following fields for an image:

cjdata.label: 1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumor
cjdata.PID: patient ID
cjdata.image: image data
cjdata.tumorBorder: a vector storing the coordinates of discrete points on tumor border.
		For example, [x1, y1, x2, y2,...] in which x1, y1 are planar coordinates on tumor border.
		It was generated by manually delineating the tumor border. So we can use it to generate
		binary image of tumor mask.
cjdata.tumorMask: a binary image with 1s indicating tumor region


**ABSTRACT:** This research project focuses on brain tumor analysis using a combination of custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, transfer learning, and image segmentation techniques The main goal is twofold: accurate brain tumor classification and tumor accurate zone segmentation from MRI images. The custom CNN image and pre-trained images are used and optimized for grayscale MRI images for classification. These models receive extensive training and evaluation, resulting in promising levels of accuracy. In parallel, the U-Net algorithm is used to achieve high tumor area segmentation accuracy. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insight into the specific diagnosis and location of brain tumors and contributes to advances in medical imaging studies
